NAME
    Simple Shell - Run a Shell that can understand and output in response to basic inputs to navigate in the OS
    
SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTIION
    This Simple Shell is a basic interpreter that can output commands based on
    inputs or allocated files.

    This shell is started with standard input to the terminal which makes it begin in
    interactive state.  Non interactive modes can be relied on via simple programs

    Once in Interactive Mode a prompt is displayed that reads inputs, with said command line argument being invoked


COMMANDS
    If the input command contains no slashes, the shell will seek for the function.
    If said function exists, it will be called.  If it is unable to be found, it will look in the
    builtins, and call that if neccesary.

    If the input is neither a function or a builtin, and has no slashs, it will search the elements and directory for a match.
    These are connected in the shell by a accessable hash table.
    A full such is performed only if the command is not found in the hash table. if the search fails, it will attempt to find a defined function
    it will invoke a Command Not Found and add its paramaters.

    If all functions are pulled successfuly, they are set and output with the remaining arguments.
